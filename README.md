# YoloSec-Framework
A framework for doing security by the seat of your pants.  Assuming you're wearing any.  Please God, don't tell me you're not wearing any pants...  Unless you're a cute infosec girl then it's cool. 

Break shit in production and blame the devs.
Push code releases without source control
rm -rf all the things.  
shitpost and troll
Take that "we are legion" shit and shove it up your ass 
Drink, do drugs, and act like your boss is right next to you calling you a pussy for not taking that next shot (cause if you have a cool boss that's exactly what he's doing).

#YOLO motherfuckers!
