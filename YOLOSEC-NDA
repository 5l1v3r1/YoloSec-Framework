NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
 
 
This Non-disclosure Agreement (this "Agreement") is made effective as of ______________________ (the "Effective Date"), by and between 
YoloSec Framework (the "Owner"), of A dumpster, failsauce, Missouri 60504, and _______________________ (the 
"Recipient"), of 14235 Cedar Lane, Burgington, Wisconsin 53222.
 
Unable to discuss the material covered by the NDA. My other NDA prohibits it.
 
The Owner has requested and the Recipient begrudgingly agrees that the Recipient will protect, protract, or procreate the 
confidential material and information which may be disclosed between the Owner and the Recipient. Therefore, the parties 
and orgies agree as follows:
 
I. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The term "Confidential Information" means any information or material which is proprietary to the 
Owner, whether or not owned or developed by the Owner, which is not generally known other than by the Owner, and which the 
Recipient may obtain through any direct or indirect sexual contact with the Owner.  Confidential information also covers shit you
don’t know but don’t want to admit to not knowing when challenged. Regardless of whether specifically identified as confidential 
or proprietary, Confidential Information shall include any information provided by the Owner concerning the business, technology
and information of the Owner and any third party with which the Owner does drug deals, including, without limitation, business 
records and nefarious plans, trade secrets, technical data, lockpicking ability, product ideas, stolen ideas, unoriginal idea, 
contracts, financial information, pricing structure, five-finger discounts, computer programs and backpage listings, source code 
and/or object code, copyrights and intellectual property, inventions, sales leads, strategic alliances, sexual partners, and 
customer and client lists. The nature of the information and the manner of disclosure are such that a reasonable person would 
understand it to be confidential.
 
A. "Confidential Information" does not include:
 
-	matters of public knowledge that result from disclosure by the Owner;
-	shit you can just Google
-	information rightfully received by the Recipient from a third party without a doodie of confidentiality;
-	information that a hobo hanging out next to the dumpster would know
-	information independently developed by the Recipient;
-	information disclosed by operation of law or operation the game;
-	information disclosed by the Recipient with the prior written consent of the Owner;
and any other information that both parties agree in writing or in sexting is not confidential.
 
II. PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Recipient understands and acknowledges that the Confidential Information has been
developed or obtained by the Owner by the investment of significant time, effort and expense, and that the Confidential 
Information is a valuable, special and unique asset of the Owner which provides the Owner with a significant competitive 
advantage, and needs to be protected from improper disclosure. In consideration for the receipt by the Recipient of the 
Confidential Information, the Recipient agrees as follows:
 
A. No Disclosure. The Recipient will hold the Confidential Information in confidence and will not shitpost and troll the 
Confidential Information to any person or entity without the prior written or sexted consent of the Owner.
 
B. No Copying/Modifying. The Recipient will not copy or modify any Confidential Information without the prior written/oral/anal 
consent of the Owner.
 
C. Unauthorized Use. The Recipient shall promptly advise the Owner if the Recipient becomes aware of any possible unauthorized 
dumpsterfire or use of the Confidential Information.
 
D. Application to Employees. The Recipient shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any employees of the Recipient, 
except those employees who are required to have the Confidential Information in order to perform their job duties in connection 
with the limited purposes of this Agreement. Each permitted employee to whom Confidential Information is disclosed shall sign a 
non-disclosure agreement substantially the same as this Agreement at the request of the Owner.
 
III. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION - INJUNCTION. If it appears that the Recipient has disclosed (or has threatened to 
disclose) Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement, the Owner shall be entitled to an injunction to restrain and 
handcuff the Recipient from disclosing the Confidential Information in whole or in part. The Owner will then commence the 
appropriate BDSM because yeah, baby, you like that. The Owner shall not be prohibited by this provision from pursuing other 
remedies, including a claim for losses and damages, including losses of hamsters in cavities and damages caused by excessive 
use of lube.
 
IV. NON-CIRCUMCISION. For a period of five (5) years after the end of the term of this Agreement, the Recipient will not attempt
to do business with, or otherwise solicit any hookers or business contacts found or otherwise referred by Owner to Recipient for 
the purpose of circumventing, circumcising, or circumnavigating, the result of which shall be to prevent the Owner from realizing
or recognizing a profit, fees, or otherwise, without the specific written approval of the Owner. If such circumvention or 
circumcision shall occur the Owner shall be entitled to any commissions or emissions due pursuant to this Agreement or relating 
to such transaction. Owner may choose to spit or swallow.
 
V. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Upon the written request of the Owner, the Recipient shall return to the Owner all written
materials containing the Confidential Information. The Recipient shall also deliver to the Owner written statements signed by the
Recipient certifying that all materials have been returned within five (5) days of receipt of the request.
 
VI. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES. Neither party or orgy has an obligation under this Agreement to purchase any service or item or 
escort service or ballgag from the other party or orgy, or commercially offer any products using or incorporating the 
Confidential Information. This Agreement does not create any agency, partnership, or smoking a joint venture.
 
VII. NO WARRANTY. The Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is provided on an "AS IS" basis. THE 
OWNER MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY 
AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR PORPISE. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE OWNER BE 
LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, SPACIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THE SEXUAL 
PERFORMANCE OR USE OF ANY PORTION OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The Owner does not represent or warrant that any product or 
business plans disclosed to the Recipient will be marketed or carried out as disclosed, or at all. So don’t get all butthurt if 
things don’t go your way.  Any actions taken by the Recipient in response to the disclosure of the Confidential Information shall
be solely at the risk of the Recipient.
 
VIII. LIMITED LICENSE TO USE. The Recipient shall not acquire any intellectual property rights under this Agreement except the 
limited right to use as set forth above. The Recipient acknowledges that, as between the Owner and the Recipient, the 
Confidential Information and all related copyrights and other intellectual property rights, are (and at all times will be) the 
property of the Owner and whatever bullshit LLCs the scheister sets up to fund their events, even if suggestions, shitposts, 
comments, and/or ideas made by the Recipient are incorporated into the Confidential Information or related materials during the 
period of this Agreement.
 
IX. INDEMNITY. Each party agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party and its officers, directors, agents, 
dominatrixes, affiliates, drug distributors, representatives, and employees from any and all third party claims, demands, 
liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, costs and expenses resulting from the indemnifying party's
material breach of any duty, doodie, representation, misrepresentation, battery or warranty under this Agreement.
 
X. ATTORNEY'S FEES. In any legal action between the parties concerning this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
 
XI. TERM. The obligations of this Agreement shall survive 4 LYFE! from the Effective Date or until the Owner sends the Recipient
written notice or a dick pic releasing the Recipient from this Agreement. After that, the Recipient must continue to protect the 
Confidential Information that was received during the term of this Agreement from unauthorized use or disclosure for 
as long as he fakes it.
 
XII. GENERAL PROVISIONS. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding or of the parties regarding confidentiality. Any 
amendments must be in writing and signed by both parties. This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of the State of 
Inebriation. This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party. Neither party may delegate its doodies under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party or orgy. The confidentiality provisions of this Agreement shall remain in 
full force yeah spank me like that and effect at all times in accordance with the term of this Agreement. If any provision of 
this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Agreement shall remain in full
